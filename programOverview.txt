TODO CASES:
    deadlines:
        - less two wks
        - greater/equal two wks -> put event in calendar at deadline,
            update when deadline is less than two wks
    timespan:
        - less/equal 50 min
        - greater 50 min -> break up into todos less/equal 50 min

    -> 3 possible cases:
        - less two wks & - less/equal 50 min
        - less two wks & - greater 50 min
        - greater/equal two wks

SCHEDUELING CASES:
    INVARIANTS:
    - 5 min buffer between events
    - allow 1 hr lunch
    - Scheduling during Event or Task
    - "         " before 06:00
    - "         " after 22:00

    MILD INVARIANTS:
    (in order of preferred violation)
    - don't schedule Task from same Todo consecutively
    - "             " on weekends
    - "             " after 18:00
    - "             " before 09:00

SCHEDUELING PRINCIPLES:
    (1) Todo w/ earlier deadlines get earlier slots
    (2) Must scheduele enough Task to satisfy Todo.timespan before
        Todo.deadline
        - if not possible can violate MILD INVARIANTS, in order of:
        (1) after 18:00
        (2) before 9:00
        (3) on weekends
        - raise InsufficientTimeException if still not possible to scheduele
        sufficient Task
    (3) Can move all Task to satisfy (1) & (2)
    (4) Can store Todo w/ deadline greater than two wks then scheduele
        them once deadline less/equal two wks
